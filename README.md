A deliciously elegant PHP cURL wrapper.

This is currently untested. Literally. Like I haven't tested any of this code formally or informally.  I just wrote it.  If you manage to get a hold of this before I get to test it later today, I implore you to let me know how it goes.

Don't let the tests folder fool you. It is empty.
